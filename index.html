            </h2>
            A recent graduate who is looking for entry level jobs in the field of data science. 
            With a passion for using my knowledge in data and algorithms to solve complex real-world 
            problems, I am eager to make meaningful contributions while gaining professional experience
            and growing my career in data science.

            Also, I recently achieved Guardian Level in 
            <a href="https://leetcode.com/u/JerryGu1/" target="_blank">LeetCode</a>, 
            with a current contest rating of 2172, placing me in the top 1.2% of users.

            <h2>Background</h2>

            <h3>Early life</h3>
            I had a passion for mathematics ever since my early school years, as I studied
            contest-level math a few grades ahead. I skipped grade 9 and 10 math in high school
            and was on the student honour roll (group III) for the 2017 Cayley Contest.
            
            I also discovered an interest in competitive programming during high school, 
            as I engaged in competitive programming platforms such as 
            <a href="https://dmoj.ca/user/Jerry_Gu" target="_blank">DMOJ</a> and participated in computing contests.

            <h3>Undergraduate studies</h3>
            I began my undergraduate studies in Fall 2019 with an Honours Mathematics plan at the 
            University of Waterloo. During my 1st year, I opted for the advanced stream of most math courses, which involved 
            diving deep into theoretical concepts through rigorous proofs. As my experiences with math contests 
            honed my creative problem-solving skills, I was well prepared to take on this challenge. I declared 
            Statistics as my major in my 2nd year, as it was the field of mathematics that sparked my interest the 
            most. As I delved deeper into the subject, I became fascinated by the potential of data-driven insights 
            through statistical methodologies and computer science to revolutionize diverse fields. This fascination 
            led me to the decision to choose a career in data science. During my 3rd year, I focused on statistical 
            learning courses, immersing myself in the realm of data science and laying the foundation for my future 
            studies. 
            In Fall 2022, I completed my Bachelor of Mathematics degree with a major in Statistics and minor in physics
            (with honour roll, as I maintained an average grade of 88). 
            
            
            <h3>Graduate studies</h3>
            Subsequently in Fall 2022, I commenced my graduate studies at the University of Waterloo, pursuing 
            a master's degree in data science and AI.
            During the initial two terms of my master's program, I learned various data science topics, 
            including data analysis, distributed computing, and intro to ML/AI. I then undertook an eight-month 
            co-op at Roche as a data science intern, where I developed a dashboard with RShiny and worked 
            on research projects on AI models. In my final term, I studied AI topics 
            such as graph neural networks, foundation models, and computer vision. In spring 2024, I 
            graduated with an average grade of 89.
